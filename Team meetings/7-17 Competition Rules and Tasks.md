#### Autonomous Functions:
1. Docking (15 points)
2. Following a red line along the wall (25 points)
3. Identifying dead fish from the live ones (10 points)
4. Creating photomosaic/mapping of the sea floor (20 points)

<u>Current priorities:</u>
1. Basic controls/functionality of the ROV
2. Build the simulator


<u>Questions:</u>
+ Do we need an Arduino? How do they work?
+ Can a raspberry pi interface with the motors directly?
